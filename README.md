🐦 Bird Detection using OpenCV

Overview
This project uses OpenCV to detect birds in images or video streams using classical computer vision techniques such as background subtraction and contour detection. It's a lightweight solution that doesn't require deep learning frameworks or large datasets.

Features
Bird detection in video using motion analysis

Works with webcam or video files

Simple and fast using only OpenCV

Lightweight and easy to deploy on edge devices

Requirements
Python 3.6+

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy

How It Works
The bird detection pipeline includes:

Background subtraction to isolate moving objects

Contour detection to identify potential birds

Filtering based on size/shape to reduce false positives

Usage
Detect birds in a video file
bash
Copy
Edit
python bird_detector.py --video data/sample_video.mp4
Detect birds from a live webcam feed
bash
Copy
Edit
python bird_detector.py --webcam
Arguments
Argument	Description
--video	Path to input video file
--webcam	Use live webcam feed instead of a file
--output	Path to save output video (optional)

Example

Bird detected using background subtraction and contour filtering.

Limitations
Works best in outdoor scenes with a stable background

Sensitive to camera motion or lighting changes

Cannot classify bird species (detection only)

Future Work
Integrate deep learning models for better accuracy

Add bird species classification

Improve tracking across frames
